# OpenGl-scripts

Hello guys,<br>
This repo contains my OpenGl work that I've been learning for sometime now.<br
A list of items:<br>
1.)<b>Bounce3D</b> : This script generates 3D balls bouncing on a platform.It has key controlled camera.Use the arrow keys to see the project at different angles.<br>
2.)<b>Light torus</b> : Generates a controllable mesh.What I mean by that is you can control the quality of the mesh of a torus in real-time on the command of just a few key strokes.<br>
3.)<b>Moon</b>: Generates a rotating sphere of the appearance of moon, showing the different phases of Moon.<br>
4.)<b>Teapot</b> : Generates a teapot with a light source revolving around it,showing the different views of it accordingly.
